Currently we are working on a project in which we have to perform the VAPT of 110 IPs and Nessus generated IP wise vulnerability reports. To prepare a report using those output , report will be super time consuming as copying IP from each vulnerability. so ease out that process i have created this . it will simply extract Vulnerabilities according to "High, Medium and Low" categories and save the corresponding IP addresses on which these vulnerabilities exist.
